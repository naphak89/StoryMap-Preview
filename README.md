# StoryMap 📍
*Social media app for Meeting new friends outside your social circle through the map*

### ⚠️⚠️Attention!⚠️⚠️
*This repository is only for showcasing the app (scroll down for the video demo). The real code for the real app will not be uploaded because this is an actual startup that I made and will be launched September 2025, stay tuned!*

## Current Tech Stack
- Firestore from Firebase for real-time database
- React-native (Expo, typescript) for the app development
- Work on Expo Development Build and Expo EAS for libraries that require native code
- Use Mapbox for the map API ([RNMapbox](https://github.com/rnmapbox/maps))
- Designed and developed all by me

**Noted that**
- This is just a demo, not a production-grade app
- Haven't implemented the function to cache the images, that is why the images were retrieved every time it is displayed
- App UI/UX can be a lot more improved
