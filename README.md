# StoryMap üìç
### Social media app for Meeting new friends outside your social circle through the map

## Current Tech Stack:
- Firestore from Firebase for real-time database
- React-native (Expo, typescript) for the app development
- Work on Expo Development Build and Expo EAS for libraries that require native code
- Use Mapbox for the map API ([RNMapbox](https://github.com/rnmapbox/maps))
- Designed and developed all by me

## ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èAttention!‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
Code in this directory is just the initial code when I started to set up the configuration, map api etc. on the app, NOT the actual code for the app.
**The real code for the real app will not be uploaded because this is an actual startup that I made and will be launched September 2025, stay tuned!**
