**📝 Noted that**
- This is just a demo, not a production-grade app
- Haven't implemented the function to cache the images, that is why the images were retrieved every time it is displayed
- App UI/UX can be a lot more improved

## 🤖 Current Tech Stack
- Firestore from Firebase for real-time database (just for prototype, in real app will use things that are more complicated but more scalable)
- React-native (Expo, typescript) for the app development
- Work on Expo Development Build and Expo EAS for libraries that require native code
- Use Mapbox for the map API ([RNMapbox](https://github.com/rnmapbox/maps))
- Designed on figma
- All designed and dev by me
