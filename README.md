# ~~StoryMap~~ -> 🍧HOUT! (We pivoted the project)
~~Meet new people who are already in your environment, but you just never meet them yet!~~  ~~StoryMap is a Social app for meeting new people who live their lives around you using a map of your live location~~

**-> Easiest way to make friends in 2025. HOUT! is a GenZ social media app for finding people or groups to hang out based on your interest!**

# ✨What It Does
1) Let you find individuals with the same interest
2) Let you gather people in groups to hangout (you can make a hangout room and post on the feed. Choose to accept or reject people to join the hangout group)

# 🧨Market Opportunity
**HOUT! is the first mover for a social media app for making friends through casual & spontaneous hangout.**

THERE IS NO DIRECT COMPETITOR for HOUT!
- Traditional Social Medias are for your existing connections not the new ones
- No one will follow you back on social media unless they already know you
- First App that focuses on casual & spontaneous hangout
- We are the first-ever social media app that helps Gen Z hang out with new friends
- Event apps like Meetup and others are for formal and scheduled events, which is not what we are focusing on

**📝 Noted that**
- This is just a demo, not a production-grade app
- Haven't implemented the function to cache the images, that is why the images were retrieved every time it is displayed
- App UI/UX can be a lot more improved
