# ~~StoryMap~~ -> HOUT! (We pivoted the project)
~~Meet new people who are already in your environment, but you just never meet them yet!~~  ~~StoryMap is a Social app for meeting new people who live their lives around you using a map of your live location~~

**-> Easiest way to make friends in 2025. HOUT! is a GenZ social media app for finding people or groups to hang out based on your interest!**

# What It Does
1) Let you find individuals with the same interest
2) Let you gather people in groups to hangout (you can choose to accept or reject people to join the hangout group)

# üß® Market Opportunity
**HOUT! is the first mover for a social media app for making friends through casual & spontaneous hangout.**

THERE IS NO DIRECT COMPETITOR for HOUT!
- Traditional Social Medias are for your existing connections not the new ones
- No one will follow you back on social media unless they already know you
- Event apps like meetups and others are for formal, scheduled events which is not what we are focusing on
- We are the first ever social app for Gen Z to make new friends through real-life casual hangouts

**üìù Noted that**
- This is just a demo, not a production-grade app
- Haven't implemented the function to cache the images, that is why the images were retrieved every time it is displayed
- App UI/UX can be a lot more improved

## ü§ñ Current Tech Stack
- Firestore from Firebase for real-time database (just for prototype, in real app will use things that are more complicated but more scalable)
- React-native (Expo, typescript) for the app development
- Work on Expo Development Build and Expo EAS for libraries that require native code
- Use Mapbox for the map API ([RNMapbox](https://github.com/rnmapbox/maps))
- Designed on figma
- All designed and dev by me
